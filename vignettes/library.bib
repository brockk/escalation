  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to describe and illustrate an outcome-adaptive Bayesian procedure, proposed by Thall and Cook (2004), for assigning doses of an experimental treatment to successive cohorts of patients. The method uses elicited (efficacy, toxicity) probability pairs to construct a family of trade-off contours that are used to quantify the desirability of each dose. This provides a basis for determining a best dose for each cohort. The method combines the goals of conventional Phase I and Phase II trials, and thus may be called a "Phase I-II" design. We first give a general review of the probability model and dose-finding algorithm. We next describe an application to a trial of a biologic agent for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, including a computer simulation study to assess the design's average behavior. To illustrate how the method may work in practice, we present a cohort-by-cohort example of a particular trial. We close with a discussion of some practical issues that may arise during implementation.},

  title = {Sequential Designs for Phase {{I}} Clinical Trials with Late-Onset Toxicities.},
  volume = {56},
  issn = {0006-341X},
  abstract = {Traditional designs for phase I clinical trials require each patient (or small group of patients) to be completely followed before the next patient or group is assigned. In situations such as when evaluating late-onset effects of radiation or toxicities from chemopreventive agents, this may result in trials of impractically long duration. We propose a new method, called the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM), that allows patients to be entered in a staggered fashion. It is an extension of the continual reassessment method (CRM; O'Quigley, Pepe, and Fisher, 1990, Biometrics 46, 33-48). We also note that this time-to-toxicity approach can be applied to extend other designs for studies of short-term toxicities. We prove that the recommended dose given by the TITE-CRM converges to the correct level under certain conditions. A simulation study shows our method's accuracy and safety are comparable with CRM's while the former takes a much shorter trial duration: a trial that would take up to 12 years to complete by the CRM could be reduced to 2-4 years by our method.},
