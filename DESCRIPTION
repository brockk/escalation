Description: Methods for working with dose-finding clinical trials. We start by 
    providing a common interface to various dose-finding methodologies like CRM, 
    BOIN, and 3+3. We then add optional embellishments to provide extra 
    desirable behaviour, like avoiding skipping doses, stopping after n patients
    have been treated at the recommended dose, or demanding that n patients are 
    treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining together these 
    embellishments using magrittr's pipe operator, it is simple to tailor the 
    behaviour of dose-finding designs so that they perform how you want. 
    Furthermore, using this flexible interface for creating dose-finding 
    designs, it is simple to run simulations or calculate dose-pathways for 
    future cohorts of patients.
