Description: Methods for working with dose-finding clinical trials. We start by 
    providing a common interface to various dose-finding methodologies like the
    continual reassessment method (CRM) by O'Quigley et al. (1990) 
    <doi:10.2307/2531628>, the Bayesian optimal interval design (BOIN) by Liu & 
    Yuan (2015) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12089>, and the 3+3 described by Korn et al. 
    (1994) <doi:10.1002/sim.4780131802>. We then add optional embellishments to 
    provide extra desirable behaviour, like avoiding skipping doses, stopping 
    after n patients have been treated at the recommended dose, or demanding 
    that n patients are treated before stopping is allowed. By daisy-chaining 
    together these embellishments using the pipe operator from 'magrittr', it is
    simple to tailor the behaviour of dose-finding designs so that they do what 
    you want. Furthermore, using this flexible interface for creating 
    dose-finding designs, it is simple to run simulations or calculate 
    dose-pathways for future cohorts of patients.
