\title{Get an object to fit the BOIN model using the BOIN package.}
\usage{
get_boin(
  num_doses,
  target,
  use_stopping_rule = TRUE,
  stop_when_deescalation_impossible = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_doses}{Number of doses under investigation.}

\item{target}{We seek a dose with this probability of toxicity.}

\item{use_stopping_rule}{TRUE to use the toxicity stopping rule described in
Yan et al. (2019). FALSE to suppress the authors' stopping rule, with the
assumption being that you will test the necessity to stop early in some other
way.}

\item{stop_when_deescalation_impossible}{TRUE to stop a trial and recommend
no dose when the advice is to de-escalate but de-escalation is impossible
because we are already at the lowest dose. Note that this feature was
requested by a user. This param is FALSE by default so that behaviour matches
what was described in the publication. The original authors do advocate this
behaviour.}

\item{...}{Extra args are passed to \code{\link[BOIN]{get.boundary}}.}
}
\value{
an object of type \code{\link{selector_factory}} that can fit the
BOIN model to outcomes.
}
\description{
Get an object to fit the BOIN model using the BOIN package.

\examples{
target <- 0.25
model1 <- get_boin(num_doses = 5, target = target)

outcomes <- '1NNN 2NTN'
model1 \%>\% fit(outcomes) \%>\% recommended_dose()
