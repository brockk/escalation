Code

* Should mean_prob_tox(x) for boin_selector & tpi_selector (and elsewhere) add
names?
* Should mean_prob_tox(x) for boin_selector & tpi_selector provide a value for
untested doses? E.g. median_prob_tox(x) for those classes does not.
* Implement the finally_select_tpi_dose() selector, as described by Ji et al
on p.239 of their 2007 paper.
* Also, add a finally selector for Mozgunov + Jaki CIPD method.
* ? simulate_trials needs sample_patient_arrivals, previous_outcomes, and
next_dose = 1 in documentation?
* Implement get_prob_tox_curve using algorithm on p.11 of Liu & Yuan (2015) for
sampling simulation scenario curves.


Docs

* Table of selectors in rows and cols for "affects dose selection" and
"affects stopping"
* Make an exhaustive bulleted list of ways of getting a selector_factory in
selector_factory.Rd
